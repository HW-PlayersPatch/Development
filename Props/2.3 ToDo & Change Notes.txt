_2.3 Build 8 ToDo_
Features
	Add a Mission AI Attack Damage adjuster
		People want to set reinforcements to 0.5, and up the difficulty with this!
		Try to average the expected player fleet with the actual player fleet for more consistent gameplay.
		WeaponDamageUpgrade125
	Play vs 200% AI in MP, do we need a 300%?
Definite Changes
	Torpedo frigates cluster torp speed up to 350 to catch corvettes.
		Likely need to re-balance vs laser vettes afterwards.
	Hiig Destroyers
		Make in-combat regen same as build 7.
		Make out of combat regen noticably much better.
	Kushan Cloaked Fighters
		Regeneration added: 0 => 240 The only strike with inherent regeneration. Cloaked fighters will regenerate completely in 4 minutes.
	Kushan Assault frigs always beat Tai Assault Frigs. Likely another targetbox problem, where one ship is a bigger target than the other. Try to tweak setTargetBox and layoutBound.
	Kushan/Taiidan Assault Frigate increase penetration vs hw2 corvettes.
		Origionally set up a bit worse than torps, they can now perform a bit better than torps vs hw2 corvs.
		They seem fine as is vs hw1 corvs, as assault frigate accuracy was already buffed.
	Heavy Corvs buff penetration vs frigs.
		Test: should be between pulsar and laser damage.
	Support Frigates
		Range for repair beam up: 1000 => 1250 (+25%
		Damage' multiplier vs frigates up: 1.0 => 1.5 (+50%) (tai_supportgun1heal.wepn) More like anti-damage, this is a buff to the healing factor against frigates
Maybe Changes, Need Testing
	Pulsars lower penetration vs frigs (Fear/Ghost were thinking 10% nerf)
		Looks like they're just as strong in 2.1, accuracy is better than hw2c tho.
	Missile Corvs penetration vs hw2 fighters up a bit. Compare to hw2c tests. They only feel good vs corvs and colls, when they should be OK vs fighters too.
Test
	All fighters and corvettes vs collectors. Adjust penetration as needed.
		hw2c: 20 Hiig Int vs 4 lv2 Hiig colls = 160sec
			Target 120-130 seconds now that full upgrades are easier to get.
		Fear: along with collector hp upgrade nerf, certain units are underperforming vs colls in general
		Fear: ints (all, especially hw1), bombers (all), assault frigates (hw1), destroyers (all, especially hw2)
		Fear: missile vette dps vs colls down by 10%
		I have good target times for some ships written down, things aren't where they should be for some ships right now.
	Torps vs collectors. Keep shots to kill the same as the previous build.



_Implimented_
Features & Bug Fixes
	Added an Observer mode to spectate multiplayer matches.
	Added an AI Attack Damage adjuster to multiplayer and player vs cpu. This can be used to increase the AI's attack damage for a more challenging game.
	Lowered the maximum Mission Difficulty scale to 2 in the options menu. (If desired, its possible to set this up to 5 in your PLAYERCFG.LUA file)
	Addressed HWR's major Cross Race Docking Bug. Hiigaran/Vaygr fighters and corvettes will no longer dock with other races. Previously, regenerated Hiigaran/Vaygr ships would be unable to launch from Kushan/Taiidan Repair Corvettes, Support Frigates, and Resource Controllers leading to really bad lag and multiple glitches.
	Kushan Ion Cannon Frigates are now pronounced correctly as 'Cannon', previously they were being pronounced as 'Cannit'.
Campaign
	Fixed a rules of engagement bug that caused many Turanic, Kadeshi, Junkyard, and Keeper ships to sometimes stop attacking unexpectedly and behave passively.
	In Homeworld 1, captured Turanic Ion Array Frigates and Kadeshi Multi-beam Frigates can now be retired immediately.
	In Homeworld 1 Mission 2, captured Turanic Heavy Corvettes can now be repaired.
	In Homeworld 2 Mission 5, lowered the Vaygr captial ship health upgrade to be closer to hw2c. (this was unintentionally altered in the 2.0 patch)
	In Homeworld 2, applied some Hiigaran research cost/build time changes from the 2.0, 2.1, and 2.205 patches. These changes were made in multiplayer, but were accidently missed in the campaign. The campaign research stats now better match multiplayer.
	In Homeworld 2 Mission 13, lowered the Vaygr corvette, frigate, and captial ship health upgrades to be closer to hw2c. (these were unintentionally altered in the 2.0 patch)
Balance (Key Points, Finer details can be captured by Stats Tool)
	Vaygr resource collectors ru capacity 208->200 (to balance harvesting with Hiigaran. Vaygr still starts with one extra collector to make up for their Flagship's poor harvesting.)
	Hiigaran/Vaygr Scout sensors range down 18% (scouting is too easy in hwr)
	Hiigaran/Vaygr Minelayer cost 800->400 (buff, hw1 are 275)
	Tweaked corvette penetration vs fighters, as Light Corvettes were over-performing.
	Hiigaran/Vaygr Resource Collector upgraded health down 20% (5000->4000 to match hw2c)
	Vaygr Hyperspace Platform build time 45->30sec (buff)
	Kushan/Taiidan Resource Collector build time 50->45sec, speed up 87% (speed is now relatively closer to hw1c. Harvesting has been adjusted for the speed change. Harvesting for all four races is within 1% of each other after 20minutes of harvesting.)
	Kushan/Taiidan Resource Collector health down 17% (6000->5000, Hiigaran/Vaygr went from 5000->4000)
	Kushan/Taiidan Resource Controller speed 100->165 (relatively closer to hw1c)
	Kushan/Taiidan Scout sensors range down 27%, speed burst ability duration reduced from 50secs to 30secs, and top speed reduced 4%. (was too hard to deny hw1 scouting)
	Kushan Cloaked Fighter ability duration increased from 60 to 240sec, recharge 20 to 60sec (closer to hw1c).
	Taiidan Defense Fighters attack style is now closer to hw1c. Their laser weapon has been adjusted to be more consistent, and it now prioritizes mines over missiles.
	Kushan/Taiidan Repair Corvette speed up 12% (relatively closer to hw1c)
	Kushan/Taiidan Light Corvette speed up 4% (relatively closer to hw1c)
	Kushan/Taiidan Heavy Corvette speed up 18% (relatively closer to hw1c)
	Kushan/Taiidan Multigun Corvette speed up 11% (relatively closer to hw1c)
	Kushan/Taiidan Minelayer Corvette build time 25->35sec (relatively closer to hw1c, and to balance vs hw2 races at 45sec)
	Kushan/Taiidan Assault Frigate accuracy vs corvettes up 13% (slight buff)
	Kushan Drone Frigate speed up 24% (relatively closer to hw1c)
	Kushan Drone Frigate drone deploy time reduced by 70%, and drones now remain deployed indefinitely until you recall them (like hw1c)
	Taiidan Defense Field Frigate speed up 24% (relatively closer to hw1c)
	Kushan/Taiidan Carrier build time down 21%, 210 to 165 seconds (it was a huge blow to lose a carrier, since they took so long to build).
	Kushan/Taiidan Carrier costs up 17% 3000->3500ru (to balance the build time buff, with a frigate module Hiigaran is 3800 and Vaygr is 3100).
	Kushan/Taiidan Missile Destroyers now count againt the destroyer unit cap. Normal unit caps allow for six destroyers, two of which can be missile destroyers. (like hw1c)
	Kushan/Taiidan Cloak Generator armour/effective health up 20%, speed up 24% (relatively closer to hw1c).
	Kushan/Taiidan Cloak Generator ability duration increased from 100 to 120sec (to match hw2 races, and be closer to hw1c).
	Taiidan Expert AI now harvests resources at the same rate as the other races.
